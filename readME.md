# Python vs Cython: Playground

Repository containing material to play with python and cython and compare their performance. The following files are available in this repo:
- hello_python, where python functions are collected
- hello_cython, same but for cython functions
- tst_comparison, jupyter notebook to actually perform comparisons

Possible future steps are the implementation of a basic solver for fluid systems and to solve the heat equation.
